# Courses Service

The Courses Service is a RESTful API that provides endpoints for managing courses. It allows you to create, update, retrieve, and delete course information. The service uses an in-memory H2 database and is built with Spring Data JPA using Hibernate as the Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) tool.
